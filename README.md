# User Profile Display App

## Overview
This app showcases a simple application that interacts with the Random User Generator API to display multiple user profiles. Inspired by [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/).

## Features
- **Dynamic User Loading**: Load user profiles dynamically from the API.
- **Adjustable User Count**: Default load of 10 profiles, adjustable as per need.
- **More Users Loading**: Option to load more profiles, filterable by gender.
- **User Deletion**: Functionality to delete individual user cards.
- **Filters**: Users can filter profiles by gender or nationality.
- **Language Toggle**: Switch between English and French.

## Design & Implementation Decisions
- **No Framework**: Chose vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity and to focus on fundamental skills.
- **Simple Design**: User-friendly interface mirroring Random User Generator's style.
- **Algorithmic Focus**: Emphasized on fetching, displaying data from API, and interactive features.
